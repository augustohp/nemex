welcome to nemex!

Thank you for downloading our app. Your are just a few steps away from using nemex:
nemex doesnâ€™t need a database. Just unzip nemex.zip, fire up your ftp-client of choice and copy the files to any directory on your web server.

As soon as you successfully uploaded them, navigate to the /projects folder and set the permissions to 777.

Open config.php in your nemex-folder and change USERNAME and PASSWORD to anything you want.

Now you should add it to your iPhones homescreen for easy and quick access.
If you have any question, just ping us @nemex_io :)
